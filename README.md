see `lib/tiny_rts.rb` for usage.

this is a tiny text-based engine for prototyping real-time strategy games, with
a multiplayer server. I don't generally accept patches, but I'm occasionally
open to interesting ideas, and the code is open and the license is permissive.

the design of this prototyping engine is influenced by my favorite rts games,
which come mostly from 1990s rts games for pc.

please enjoy.
